#NOTE my error before was that i made the x-axis in the last/plt.plot argument df['sex'],
#even tho we set that as constants, either/or 1 & 2 for male/female
#so what that did was just make two vertical bars at x=1 & x=2. but what does that RANGE
#represent?? remem the vertical axis represents the percentage voting yes/in favor
#so that range of percentages voting yes/in favor is the range ACROSS THE AGES!!!
#that's the only loose variable here, as we're 'controlling' for / i.e. HOLDING the other
#factors in the prediction model constant!=> education & sex. (and education squared of course too
#will be constant then too
#i should've been clued that that was the target x-axis
#for here since that's what we set up on np.linspace and the others we held constant

#oh yeah and we should also note that when we plot these, these include for ALL education levels, don't filter / subset
#for just educ=12 like what the prediction line comes from / is based off of
