145,Kennedy Brown Leukemia Fund,U.S. Dollar,,of $5k goal,3,"Kennedy was diagnosed with AML-APL Leukemia on October 1, at 23
  years old. She has been hospitalized since September 30 and will
  remain there for at least a month. During this time Kennedy has of
  course not been able to work, her long time boyfriend Danny and her
  parents, Jackie and Bob, have been spending as much time as possible
  by her side during this time. The goal of this fundraiser is to ensure Kennedy can focus on her

455,Help our friends get intensive therapy for PTSD,U.S. Dollar,,of $550 goal,10,"I'm fundraising for intensive PTSD therapy for an anonymous
    friend, someone that a lot of you know and love. This therapy helped
    me majorly in one month of weekly appointments, events that had been
    reoccurring in my head for years have stopped. So I want to all of
    my friends who have PTSD, so many of us live in the shadow of our
    trauma every day. I found a very experienced therapist who's focus is primarily
    on EMDR therapy for PTSD. EMDR therapy is based on the understanding
    that PTSD symptoms are caused by dysfunctionally stored memories. While there are a lot of ways that people can get talk therapy
    for free, the barriers of finding therapists who can provide
    specialized help through the welfare systems we have are very real
    and do prevent easy access to this specific kind of care. Many
    people with PTSD put in the effort of getting into therapy that
    doesn't end up being what they need, and the weight of trying out
    and searching for therapists quickly becomes too much for people
    dealing with this mental illness.  If 20 people pitch $25 we can
    fast track a pathway to provide a community member with lasting
    mental health relief. I'd like to do this for each of my friends who have PTSD that
    want it. When we reach the goal of $550 I will start a new campaign
    over again. Let's heal our community!",https://fundrazr.com/b1tWU0

"1,935",Help a mom to fight against kidney diseases and help her family to reunite again,U.S. Dollar,,of $3k goal,24,"Hello everyone, my name is Md.Shofiqul Islam Faysal. We are from
    Bangladesh and we are middle class family. We were happy with our
    life until my beloved mother is in serious condition since April
    10th 2021. Her both kidney are damaged so she is getting
    hemodialysis 2 times in a week. In October 11th 2021 we had to
    admitted her to the ICU. My mother needs to stay at least two weeks
    more in the ICU for further observation. The main problem for us is financial problem. Our family income is
    less than 1000 USD per month and I'm with my mother taking care of
    her and can't get a job at the moment. Covic-19 ruined all of our
    savings that we had. So because of that we cannot keep up the ICU
    cost for my mother because in the current hospital ICU cost per day
    including medicine is around 550 USD. As a result we cannot keep up
    my mother's medical bills anymore. If we can raise  some fund for my
    mother then i believe my mother's life can be save. So far we have managed around 850 USD. If we can get at least 3000
    USD then it would be more than enough that will help us to complete
    my mother's treatment and save her. You can donate $20 or $30 which will help us to provide my
    mother's one week hemodialysis cost inside ICU and put back the
    loving smile of my mother that we have lost. My mother always wanted
    to see the sea but she never had a chance to see. This is my last
    chance to fulfill my mother's wish so if we can completed her
    current treatment we can make her wish comes true. My mother never
    asked anything from me ever but she wanted to be there with me. If i
    failed to do this i wouldn’t be able to find peace in my life. But
    you guys can make that happen. If you donate us to save my mother we will make sure you will see
    the daily medical progress of my mother as we will share everything
    including pictures, copy of the medical bills and medical test
    report. Also our family will pray to Almighty God for you as long as
    we alive. It doesn’t matter whether you believe in God or not. Even
    If you cannot make the donation then please at least pray for my mother.",https://fundrazr.com/91ttz6
710,Help Me Find My Happiness and Regain Even Ground,U.S. Dollar,,of $3.5k goal,17,"As some of you may know and many may not, I have been having an
  exceptionally tough time with my mental health as of late.  Over the
  course of the last few years I have lost myself and no longer know
  what or where my happiness lies.  I have been taking the medical steps
  necessary to start making some changes such as adjusting medications
  through seeing a psychiatrist, quit drinking (with a few stumbles) to
  avoid the depression that comes with alcohol abuse, regularly
  journaling and overall trying whatever I can within my power to start
  my healing.  In addition, I was let go from my current employer and my
  last date of employment is set for October 15th, 2021.  This change
  brings about a new set of challenges as I am quite concerned about my
  financial situation and the ability to maintain my bills while I plan
  out what my future looks like. I have been working since I was 14, with the exception of some time I
  took to take care of my late father.  Now is the time for me to
  reclaim my autonomy and find my true happiness and in order to do
  that, I am asking for your help.  My immediate plan is to finish out
  strong at my current employer with my head held high.  I then would
  like to take a couple weeks to get my home in order before setting out
  on a cross country trip to visit loved ones and spend some much needed
  time finding out who I am, what makes me happy and where I feel at
  home.  I know many of us are having a hard time right now emotionally,
  physically and financially.  Even if you cannot donate anything at
  this time, your kind words and support during this time are beyond
  appreciated!  While on my trip, I will be posting updates on my
  snapchat and Facebook.  If you would like to donate through a

"22,920",Help me support my brother & raise funds to support him on his road to recovery,New Zealand Dollar,,of $45k goal,82,"Hi everyone, I am Antonin (19), the younger brother of
            Alexandre (25), who fell from a 6 m height on the 23rd of
            July in a small town, Esperance, in Western Australia. The
            fall knocked him unconscious, which he remained for most of
            that day. Unfortunately it was assessed that he had a
            fractured spine and concussion along with a small internal
            bleed on the front left part of his brain. He was then urgently flown to Perth, where he underwent
            spinal surgery the next day. They kept him in the hospital
            care for another 6 days while he was unable to move without
            intense pain, nausea and dizziness. Because of the current travel restrictions, neither
            myself, my parents, or other family members are able to
            enter Australia to be with him. This has been a very big emotional strain for all of us
            as well, not to be able to reach him. Hopefully our mother can find a way to go and see him if
            Australia reopens its borders before their current estimation. Gratefully we have had friends able to provide presence
            and assistance, and he is now staying not far out of the
            city, in a town called Toodyay, where he can begin to heal
            in a calm environment surrounded by nature. He still however requires significant further care and
            tests for his brain trauma which we are looking to set up as
            soon as possible. He also needs ongoing physio and regular medical
            assessment of his spine for the next 3 months at least,
            while wearing a neck and upper body brace at all times. To make matters worse, Alexandre had unfortunately not
            yet renewed his traveling health insurance, and is now faced
            with having to cover the high cost of his medical care and
            expenses, which are presumed to go for several months. Our family does not have the means to cover this, so I
            am looking for ways to help raise what is needed . With adequate care, Alexandre will be back on his feet
            and smiling as you see him in the photo above within 6
            months to a year. At the moment the doctors diagnosis is that he is not
            going to be able to do more than careful exercise and rest
            for the next 3 months, with no long periods of standing or
            sitting for another 6 months to a year. Of course we are all looking forward to his full
            recovery, and for his benefit I hope it will take the least
            amount of time possible. His care is currently mounting by the thousands, and the
            urgently required tests to further clarify the extent of his
            brain injury are pending funds. The hospital bills are estimated at 35.000 dollars +,
            and it is likely going to be another 10.000 + for the
            further tests, assessment of his brain injury, and ongoing
            medical care for the next 6 months. This leaves Alexandre feeling very anxious and trapped
            and I want to help him and my family as much as possible. So I am asking you to help in any way you can. Please donate, if you can, and know that any amount can help. Please share as well this page with friends and family. Really anything, would be much appreciated. :-) Thank you, Antonin.",https://fundrazr.com/helpalexandre
200,Help Wanda Heal from Breast Cancer,U.S. Dollar,,of $60k goal,1,"My wife, Wanda Hebron is seeking IPT cancer treatment. Insulin potentiation therapy involves administering
    insulin at the same time as chemotherapy drugs , with the
  idea that lower chemotherapy doses are then needed because insulin
  lets more of the drug enter cells. Most insurance programs don't cover
  IPT because it's considered an alternative treatment. The costs associated with IPT are $5,500 for 5 daily treatments
  per week. Our goal is to raise $60,000 to cover the costs associated
  with this treatment which can take several months. We'd like your help to make this goal a reality. 600 people
  could make this possible with a donation of $100 each but we realize
  that is a lot of money. Any donation amount is valued and appreciated.

"12,100","Help Nicko settle unpaid hospital bills, fund his surgery, and start therapy",,,,,"Ever since Nicko's fight against COVID-19 complications started, his
  family has been striving to pool enough funds for his treatment on top
  of their day-to-day finances. The overwhelming amount of help they've
  received previously definitely lifted some of the burden off their
  shoulders and they are beyond grateful to everyone who reached out. However, his fight isn't over yet. Unpaid hospital bills, sinus surgery, and low vision therapy are
  the issues needing immediate action. HOW IS NICKO DOING? After being discharged from the hospital, he continued his medication
  at home for four (4) weeks. This meant stocking up on antibiotics and
  other medical supplies totaling to ₱2,500 per day. Aside from this, he was required to do a series of lab and
  imaging tests to monitor his meningitis and brain abscess. Blood work alone costs ₱8,000
    per test and MRI at ₱12,000 per scan. By the grace of God, the latest MRI results showed
  that swelling on his brain reduced. Despite this, the brain abscess is
  still present. There were no significant changes observed so the
  doctor advised him to continue taking antibiotics for two (2) more
  weeks. While he may recover after completing the antibiotic treatment,
  the infection could come back and trigger yet another episode of
  meningitis and appearance of brain abscess. To assist with the expenses and unpaid hospital bills, he went
  back to work even with only one functioning eye — an
  impediment he is trying to live with. WHAT'S NEXT FOR HIM? ENDOSCOPIC SINUS SURGERY - The
  bone serving as barrier between his sinus and brain is slowly eroding,
  making the risk of meningitis and brain abscess reappearance higher.
  Having the mucocele removed from his sphenoid sinus could eliminate
  that possibility. LOW VISION THERAPY - The loss of vision in his left eye made his mobility and perception
  limited. To help him adjust and continue living with this impediment,
  he has to consult a low vision specialist and undergo therapy. SETTLING UNPAID HOSPITAL
  BILLS - When he was discharged from the hospital, he left an
  outstanding balance amounting to more than ₱125,000. His discharge was processed under the agreement that he will
  pay his unsettled account after a month. The deadline is fast approaching. WHAT WILL YOUR HELP ACHIEVE? No aid or intention is big or small. Whatever you are able to
  provide, no matter how much, will be a step towards a new life for
  Nicko and his family and the days of worrying over how to live
  day-by-day will definitely be over. We hope you and your loved ones continue to be safe and strong.

  but I can help other people like you thrive more with the lessons learned. I'm an orphan, so I don't have family to help. Every donor who helps
  becomes my family and part of a community of people that make this
  educational project possible for us all, while helping with my recovery. This emergency fundraiser is my ultimate act of love and leap of
  faith that by investing in this path, I made the right choice for
  recovery which matters for you, as much as it does for me. What a Donor will Receive in Exchange for their Donation Primarily what you are receiving is the pleasure of knowing you
  helped someone in need that could save their life.  The joy you bring
  me with your presence (no matter what you give) will be PROFOUNDLY heartfelt. Everyone participating in this campaign will receive regular health
  lessons I learned, regardless of your donation level. Gifts over $500 are precious and highly valued in getting toward the
  desired goal quickly.  I want to do something very special for those
  donors, but I can't promise anything specific because it will affect
  the tax free status of this emergency fundraiser. The wisdom gathered came from two doctor's summits in which
  presentations to optimize health were offered. (Almost none of
    these doctors are paid through insurance companies.) CAUSE: Mycotoxin and Chronic Illness Doctors Summit SYMPTOMS: Reversing Alzheimers Doctors
    Summit (A common result of toxin illness.  And yes, they proved
    it is possible!!!) MEDICAL PROGRAM: Andrew Weil Center for Integrative
      Medicine at The University of Arizona, Course in Environmental Medicine FINDING HIDDEN WATER DAMAGE. Mold Finders method for identification, sampling
      and dealing with contractors. After analyzing over 70 presentations, I found common threads of
  wisdom and put together my own action plan for treatment. I will
  measure status (Labs and Cognitive Tests) before and after
  treatment and share my journey with supporters along the way . I'm absolutely confident that
      this is a journey worth sharing for ALL of us. ABOUT WHAT I LEARNED ON THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS Our immune system repairs injuries and eliminates toxins from our
  environment 24 hours a day. Our ability to eliminate or tolerate
  toxins changes with time and our life experiences. If you keep your
  body strong by making good choices over lifetime, you can have more
  bounce, energy and joy. From mold in our homes, the fumes from the products we inhale or put
  on our bodies, to eating too much sugar, or physical injuries, these
  all weaken our immune system which causes inflammation and leads to
  life threatening diseases over time. Your goal is to learn how to STOP inflammation, no matter the source. (And NOT use drugs to do it!) Good health is your greatest gift of all. Each health choice you make
  every day is an act of love for yourself and the people around you to
  have your best life possible, TOGETHER. Imagine that your whole body is like this bucket above. There is a
  limited capacity on how fast you can eliminate toxins. Avoid adding
  stuff to your bucket and get it out as fast as you can. The more you
  do to support that process with each body part and process, the
  healthier you will be at any age. Below is some of the wisdom I
      want to share with you during my recovery journey. How Our Body Processes Toxins What Bio-Toxins Are Support Your Blood and Oxygen Circulation Support Your Food Digestion Support Your Regulation of Nerves and Hormones Maintain a Strong Environmental Barrier Test Your Body And Home To Determine Status Recognize YOUR Toxic Exposure Sources (Checklist) Evaluate The Safety Of The Products You Use How To Make Your Air Healthier To Breathe Minimize Your EMF Exposure Quickly Acquire And Store The Precious Vitamin D To Fight Toxins Save Thousands Of Dollars And Inconvenience on Labs Cleaning And Keeping Your Home Healthy Much more content is available soon.  If there is a burning question
  or topic you want covered, let me know so I can prioritize that. The Solution to the Problem These small actions by many people can lead to big results. Learn about the project and donate. Help
    save a life (or many) and learn to boost your own immunity by donating. Share this project with 3 or more people. (See sharing links provided or use any method that works for
      you.) Your help here would be PROFOUNDLY appreciated. I'm
      EXHAUSTED. Think of sharing with people who can: Benefit from this wisdom, or Help this project be successful. Share your ideas to boost effectiveness of this concept. To have the positive community impact intended, all
    suggestions to improve are very welcome. ( Give ideas here. ) Here is a video I made for you. 
      I'm not very sparky right now.  I hope you find it helpful. If I am blessed with donations beyond moving expenses, it will go
  toward medical costs for detoxification and reducing chronic
  inflammation (mast cell activation).   It also empowers me the not
  only survive, but to also thrive and share this wisdom.  ~ If you are
  a donor wishing to make a substantial impact please view my action plan landing page . This fundraiser is about more than seeking help for recovery.  I
  GENUINELY want everyone touched by this project to benefit from it. Thank you for visiting.  Your

    Initiative) is an open-source crowd-funded project run by The Department of Twin Research
      & Genetic Epidemiology at King's College London in conjunction with The American Gut Project . The
    aim is to uncover the microbes associated with individuals from the
    U.K. These data will help us understand how our lifestyle choices
    and diet influence our microbiome and whether these patterns
    replicate in samples from individuals in the United States. This
    study aims to produce a large-scale collection of anonymized human
    samples and lifestyle information for researchers and provide each
    participant with an educational snapshot of their microbes. If you are a participant living outside Europe and would
      like to participate, please refer to our Microsetta Initiative page. Many people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us
    play a vital role in our health. Incredibly they make up 50 percent
    of the cells in our body, and their most important jobs include
    manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down and digesting our
    food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh nearly 2 kg (over
    4lbs). This community of bacteria behaves like an extra 'organ,'
    which we call our ""microbiome."" Research has discovered
    that small changes in our finely balanced microbial communities can
    affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood. It may even
    cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome,
    cancer, autoimmune responses, diabetes, and heart disease. What is the British Gut Project? The British Gut Project is the first of its kind in Europe! With
    your help, we will discover more about the crucial relationship
    between our health and our microbiome. On a personal level, you will
    be able to find the bacterial profile of your gut. Your unique
    microbes will help us answer questions such as 'How much does our
    choice of lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and can we
    alter our microbiome to make us healthier?' More research is needed to determine what constitutes a
    'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of bacteria are
    beneficial and why. To make this ambitious and much-needed project a
    success, we urgently need a large-scale collection of human samples.
    Over ten thousand people have signed up in America already through
    the American Gut Project, but to fully advance science, we need many
    more from Europe to participate. You can probably tell that our project focuses mainly on the
    gut, our main 'microbial home.' However, the study will also look at
    areas. Our collection kits can also be used for oral, skin, and
    nasal samples as well as samples from around your home surfaces! Join the project. We are currently not able to supply collection kits.",https://fundrazr.com/britishgut
"25,240",Andrea and Marta: Survivors Getting on their Feet,U.S. Dollar,,of $10.8k goal,296,"My name is Tim Curtis, and I live in the small mountain community of
  Monteverde, Costa Rica, where I am Executive Director of a small
  non-profit.  I became acquainted with Marta when she came into my
  office over two years ago, seeking help to feed her children, while
  her husband was dying of cancer. It has been a hard 2 years for Marta and Andrea.  In that time, both
  lost their husbands - one to cancer and the other in an accident -
  Andrea's baby (born just after her husband's death) developed a heart
  condition, and Marta, a diabetic, has undergone two partially
  successful cancer operations.  She has a serious heart condition as
  well. A little over a year ago, the two crossed paths, and decided to
  make a go of it together, selling ceviche on the beach near their home
  in Puntarenas, Costa Rica. The COVID pandemic put an end to their vending activities in March,
  and they were unsuccessful in getting aid from the government to
  replace any of their meager earnings.  We have been able to keep them
  alive with the help of two previous campaigns earlier this year. This past month has been particularly devastating.  When the two
  mothers were finally able to get some temporary employment, peeling
  shrimp, Andrea caught the COVID virus from a co-worker, and the entire
  household became infected.  All were symptomatic, and Marta was nearly
  hospitalized.  In the meantime, their house was condemned by the
  Ministry of Health because of a broken septic system and they are
  being forced to leave, as the house's owner is too poor to get it fixed. We are helping them move to a house outside the city in a much safer
  location, although the rent is higher (drugs are rampant in their
  current location, and there have been several murders in the
  neighborhood since we have known them).  They are excited about being
  able to return to vending. To get started, they will need: - $171 per month for rent = $684 for 4 months - $514 per month for food = $2,056 for 4 months - $43 per month for business permit = $172 for 4 months - estimated $77 per month for utilities = $308 for 4 months - $38 for required COVID clothing for vendors We are asking for your help in giving this household another chance
  at independence.  When you truly have nothing to start with, it is a
  very long way up, we have learned.  Each small obstacle seems
  insurmountable, when you have zero money, no relatives able to help,
  and are surrounded by others in nearly the same condition. We hope that by supplying their needs for the first few months in
  their new place (Cóbano, for those who know Costa Rica), they can
  reach a level of stability they have not had since before we met
  them.  They are hard workers, when given the chance, the children are
  bright and friendly, all are now covered by the government health care
  system, and they are hopeful about this new leap.",https://fundrazr.com/91jhN0

926,Help Emaline recover from her Vaccine Injury,Euro,,of €1.8k goal,16,"Thank you so much for coming over to my fundraiser. You can
  also find out more about my healing journey at http://www.instagram.com/emalinesrecovery and my
  main account http://www.instagram.com/emalinedelapaix Hi there. My name is Emaline and I am a Berlin based singer
  songwriter who plays piano, acoustic guitar and celtic harp and I make
  most of my living through my music. On the 17th June I received my first and only Pfizer vaccine and
  for the first few days I had a very sore arm which I thought was a
  normal side effect so just accepted it. Ten very quickly my fingers
  swelled up and within a week I could not bend my index finger or make
  a fist. Then I started having issues with my back and within 10 days
  couldn't walk properly and was in extreme pain. Because I make my
  living mostly from music but couldn't use my hand and my back was so
  bad, I had to cancel all my Summer concerts in July/August. By the time I got to mid August my side effects included extreme
  fatigue, cramps, pains, electrical shooting and tingling all over my
  body which made it hard to walk as I got them a lot in the base of my
  feet and legs. Things started getting a little better in early
  September and I felt around 50% better after taking a lot of
  vitamins/minerals that were prescribed to me by my naturopath and
  advised by the FLCCC but unfortunately that didn't last... Things went downhill again around the 3rd week of September when
  the burning, cramps etc returned with a fury and then by the first
  week of October my leg had swollen up and I ended up in hospital as
  the pain was so bad I couldn't walk properly. I spent a week in bed as
  well as 3 weeks walking on crutches which I also had to pay for
  myself. As of the first week of November I can now walk without
  crutches but I am still limping and in pain. I keep a crutch with me
  on bad days just in case. Up until now I have seen 12 doctors including regular doctors,
  neurologists, rheumatologists as well as 2 naturopaths, massage
  therapists and 2 physiotherapists. I've had x-rays on my hands, one
  nerve test on my hands and some basic blood tests including ANA and a
  blood clot test and still nothing is showing up. I was given many
  drugs since July including steroids and even anti depressants but told
  me they don't know what is wrong or what to do, so I just keep trying
  things. The last Doctor I saw was a private rheumatologist that I had
  to pay out of my own pocket including the blood tests which in total
  came to €348. I do have health insurance which I pay for
  each month so it covers the doctors visits and for that I am so
  grateful but there have been a lot of out of pocket expenses including
  anything that's considered alternative like the massages which have
  helped ease my pain as well as the naturopath, vitamins, minerals,
  medicines, the private Doctor and extra blood work not covered under
  insurance. I have also had 2 high dose Vitamin C infusions which were
  supposed to help heal cells but unfortunately for some reason I had a
  bad reaction both times. I asked the Doctor about this but she said
  it's not possible to have a bad reaction to Vit C so again I am left
  without answers. At this point I am looking at other options like hyperbaric
  oxygen therapy as well as oxygen blood cleaning therapy and/or seeing
  another more open minded private Doctor to do full tests.
  Unfortunately all of these options are out of my reach right now as I
  am not earning a lot due to my illness and have no savings. If you
  would like to support my recovery I would be so grateful to you! If you prefer you can also support me by buying my digital music

"4,784","""It’s not how much we give, but how much love we put into giving.""",Singapore Dollar,,of $80k goal,43,"I dedicate this to a fellow colleague who is a wife and mother to two
  lovely daughters, ages 8 and 2 years old. We may not be related by blood by the state she is in today tells me
  that real relationships are made by the heart and not valued less than
  that.  It may stay for a few spans of time but it gives the moment of life. 6 years ago, our paths crossed and I met her in my workplace.  She
  was a colleague, my supervisor whom we then became friends and grew
  closed.  We faced our ups and downs but despite it all, we still
  maintain our relationship. Sheila has been working in Singapore for many years and one day, her
  visa for her children has expired after many extensions.  This
  happened during the pandemic period and everyone knows how tough the
  situation can be.  She had no choice but to let go of her helper and
  return to Philippines alone with her 2 daughters leaving her husband
  behind to continue work in Singapore. While in the Philippines, she continued to work from home,
  juggling to take care of her children without the help of her husband
  and helper.  Despite the difficulties faced, she continued to be the
  devoted worker and mother to her career and family life. Unfortunately, when she found out she has colon cancer, she was
  already in Stage 4.  She is now undergoing Chemotherapy at Calamba
  Medical Centre. Going through Chemo is not only expensive but weakens her body
  as well.  Now that her husband is back in the Philippines, she is
  getting the extra support she needs. Although prayers are important, the expenses for her medical and
  chemotherapy sessions are costly. A very little key will open a very heavy door.  More often than
  not, to us, it may seem like it doesn't take much to make any big
  changes in her life but TOGETHER if we start with small steps to help
  her morally and financially, it will take her far to motivate her even
  more to fight this cancer. Sheila is not giving up at all and continues to remain positive! Let's help to contribute whatever we can so that she can regain
  her health to be the every role she needs to be in the lives of her
  loved ones. I thank you for reading and helping Sheila and her family.",https://fundrazr.com/71tBx3

  started last year. Some people like you, have asked how they can help.
  So, a group of us worked together with Tom's wife Gina to make that possible. This crowdfunding platform, Fundrazr, allows for all the
  contributions to go toward the cause directly, so it’s an effective
  and convenient way for those moved, to take part financially, or to
  create awareness by sharing links in various ways. Please take a
  moment to take in the challenges they are facing here on this campaign
  page and consider personally contributing in one of the many ways.
  You’re also invited to join us in praying for them and getting updates here. The Journey of Tom & Gina Tom and Gina's Cancer journey started in July 2020. Tom was diagnosed
  with GE Junctional Carcinoma, a malignant neoplasm metastatic cancer
  of the liver. It is stage 4 (non-curable, but treatable). With God's
  grace and current immunotherapy the doctor said he could possibly beat
  the cancer. He started chemo in July 2020. His doctors are far away and the
  treatments are over three hours each session. They often need to rely
  on others for this transportation and are grateful. Tom has not worked since July 2020 which has left them unable to
  afford the health insurance he had. He has started Social Security
  disability, and the hospital catastrophic fund paid some of the
  $108,000 bill, but are still carrying payments on the balance. In Aug. of 2021 an MRI revealed three small cancerous lesions on the
  brain which needed powerful radiation treatments which he has
  received. Tom will remain on the chemo as his cancer markers went from
  180 to 1582 and continue to fluctuate. He has trouble walking, so they
  are waiting to see if medicare will approve the purchase of a power
  chair, this may be another expense. Tom and Gina are thankful for any and all support. You can follow
  more  updates on Gina's Facebook here , and they share
  this scripture verse as a reminder that God is their strength... ""He gives power to the faint, and to him who has no
      might he increases strength."" -  Isaiah 40:29 If you can help them financially with the debt they’re incurring, or
  meeting their daily needs, know that you’re encouraging their hearts
  also. Sharing the link to this campaign to your networks via text,
  email, messenger, social media, and written letters with others to
  consider contributing is also vital in helping this campaign. Thank you for your time and please consider helping Tom and Gina

    trillions of microbes that inhabit our bodies and their impact on
    health and disease. However, opportunities for the public to get
    involved in such research have been limited. Now, American Gut gives
    you an opportunity to join this research project and learn what’s
    living on and inside you. American Gut is a project built on the open-source, open-access
    principles of the Earth Microbiome Project. The data we collect is
    de-identified and then deposited into open repositories for the
    benefit of other researchers and scientists.  By participating in
    our project, you can help contribute to research that will help the
    world understand how the microbiome affects our health. In exchange
    for your participation, we generate a report summarizing the types
    of microbes observed in your sample, and how your sample relates to
    other people in the study. While American Gut mainly focuses on the gut as this is where
    most of our microbes reside, we will also look at areas like the
    oral and skin, as these areas of the body also contain microorganisms. What will I receive for submitting a sample? Considerations before participation. It will take a few weeks to receive your
        results for stool samples and longer for those participating
        outside the U.S. (due to shipping times to send samples back to
        our lab, based at the University of California San Diego). It
        takes longer to process non-fecal samples as they are less
        common (we process similar sample types in batches to lower costs). The results you receive from submitting a sample are not for
        medical diagnoses or action. We do not provide medical
        information or recommendations based on your results. Donate to participate and claim your 'Collection Kit' perk. If You Live in the U.S. Taking part is simple! Based on your level of contribution, you
    will be able to select a collection kit from the list of options on
    the right-hand side by clicking ""Claim this perk"" (if you
    would like to receive bulk order, please email us 
    microsetta@ucsd.edu). Your kit will be shipped via FedEx within a
    few business days after payment. If You Live Anywhere Else: International participants are also welcome to join. Additional
    shipping fees may be required, along with other regulations. Please
    email us at  microsetta@ucsd.edu   before contributing so we can
    check on shipping regulations. Ideally, samples should be shipped back to our lab within 48 hours of being collected. Our kits are
    designed to protect and preserve your sample at room temperature
    during extended transit times. If you have any questions or concerns, please

"3,852",Help Us Make Ireland's Dream a Reality!,U.S. Dollar,,of $500k goal,37,"Hello, we are Megan and Mark. Over three years ago Megan gave birth
  to our beautiful baby girl, Ireland. However, during birth, an
  umbilical cord prolapse resulted in Ireland having cererbal palsy. She
  spent the first 7 weeks of life in the hospital, and we waitied
  anxiously to take her home to her older brothers. This was our first real world experience with cerebral palsy. Many
  people we talk to today don't even know what cerebral palsy is.
  Cerebral palsy is a variable type of brain injury that affects people
  in many different ways. Some children are only slightly affected,
  while others are permamently disabled, wheelchair-bound, and need
  constant attendant care. Cerebral palsy makes a huge impact on the family dynamic. Not only
  are many cerebral palsy families financially dessimated by this
  disease, but they are also stressed emotionally and physically. There are no treatments out there that are covered by insurance to
  treat or reverse cererbal palsy. However, there are many, many
  therapies available worldwide that improve cerebral palsy, and can
  have significant impacts on quality of life. Unfortunately, most of
  these therapies are difficult to obtain due to lack of insurance
  coverage and travel costs. We were lucky enough to discover and utilize many of these therapies
  for Ireland, and have seen dramatic improvements in her since using
  these therapies. We truly believe that no child with cerebral palsy
  should have his or her treatment options limited by his or her
  parent's financial status. Out of this belief, Ireland's Dream was born. Ireland's Dream is to establish a medical center that is fully
  dedicated to the treatment of people with cerebral palsy and their
  families. This Center will have the latest in treatment technologies
  that people all over the world are using for cerebral palsy, available
  under one roof. These therapies include hyperbaric oxygen, ozone
  therapy, Cuevas Medek therapy, scoliosis treatment, and vibration
  therapy. Other necessary therapies will include family counseling,
  diet/nutritional interventions, feeding therapy, assistive device
  training, and more. Our goal is to make cerebral palsy synonymous with Ireland's Dream.
  Please help us make Ireland's Dream come true for patients all over
  the country who are suffering from the debilitating disease. We thank you greatly for any support you can provide.",https://fundrazr.com/f13EF1
"11,090",Join Nese Leigh's Care Circle,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,89,"We are a group of friends who love Denise Leigh. Since her diagnosis
  with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2017, we have watched Nese
  meet the devastating challenges of this disease with humor and amazing
  grace. We want to help her maintain her quality of life as she deals
  with the day-to-day realities of a progressively degenerative disease. Here's Nese, with her latest health update: ""I’m getting weaker.
  I’m totally dependent on others to care for me. . . . My mouth and
  neck muscles are dying, so I have sleep apnea and can’t swallow. My
  legs are paralyzed, but with ALS you can feel everything. My lower
  lobes of my lungs can’t work, so I’m only breathing with my upper
  lobes. There’s much more stuff, but that’s all for now."" Nese had a tracheostomy in spring 2020 to enable her to breathe more
  easily, and she eats through a tube. She needs care 24/7, since she
  cannot move herself even to shift positions in bed. Some of this is covered by insurance and her amazing family. Much of
  it is not. Nese has caregivers who come every day, and her mom and
  sisters share a lot of the care. But for things like respite care,
  over-the-counter medications, personal items like wipes, and anything
  experimental or innovative that insurance doesn't recognize as
  necessary, the costs are out of pocket. And Nese's pockets, as you can
  imagine, have seen their fuller days. SO that's where you come in. Can you give a little? Can you give a
  lot? Anything--ANYTHING--will be welcomed and appreciated and will
  make Nese's life a little more comfortable and blessed. And you may
  consider yourself blessed in return, since that's the way these things go. Please give what you can. Thanks!",https://fundrazr.com/nesecarecircle

"15,562",Medical Care for Gideon Dodea,Euro,,of €15k goal,141,"We wish to draw your attention to our dear Gideon Dodea, a student of
  the teaching Training College in Amedzofe and parttime tour guide of
  Jolinaiko Eco Tours. If you have met him before, we are sure he has
  stolen your heart with his passion, positive energy, intelligence and
  enthusiasm. Such a brilliant young person! Sadly, a tragedy happened on the road on Monday the 21st of December,
  when he was involved in a terrible car accident in the Avatime Hills
  in the Volta Region in Ghana. He was rushed to the hospital in Ho
  where he had to undergo emergency surgery, and one of his legs had to
  be amputated. His other leg is severely damaged with multiple fractures. With this fundraiser we aim to get the money together for Gideon's
  first emergency care. Gideon will have to undergo multiple operations
  and treatments in the next couple of weeks on both legs. Without a
  good insurance coverage, there will be a heavy financial burden on his
  loved ones. With this fundraiser, Jolinaiko and Gideon's friends want to inform
  and involve everybody who worked and travelled with him, and everyone
  who is touched by this story. In these early days of shock and emergency care, it's yet unclear how
  much will be needed exactly for the multiple operations, hospital
  admission and medication. So our aim is to raise as much as possible
  to cover these early bills and reserve anything left for aftercare,
  the long revalidation process, protheses, and finding a new way of life. There will be a long journey ahead of him in these already
  financially challenging times. Please help us ease the burden for our beloved Gideon. We are very grateful for every donation. The team of Jolinaiko Eco Tours, Friends of Gideon, Apollo
